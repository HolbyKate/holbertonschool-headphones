1: Make the Header:
    Building a web page the right way, is not easy - expect if you put in place strong foundations:

    reset CSS styling
    use variables
    simple/“as generic as you can” CSS selectors
    avoid using super specific CSS selectors as much as possible
    simple HTML structure - div containers are your friend!
    Last advice: Personally, I always start to build a web page from outside to inside and from top to bottom. But you can try to other way - it’s fine - but you should structure the way that you will implement a component and not get lost with HTML tags.

    Now, your turn!

    For this first task: create the header/hero piece


2: Make the section:  “What we do…” section
    Copy files from the previous task.

    For this second task: create the “What we do…” section

    In this section, you will need custom font icons. Here the archive of it: holberton_school-icon.zip Inside you will find demo page of how to use it.

    Important: try to build as generic as you can… you will probably need some components in next section.


3: Make the section: “Our results” section
    Copy files from the previous task.

    For this third task: create the “Our results” section

    Now you can reuse components form the previous task!

Copy files from the previous task.

Last piece of the page… the Footer!
